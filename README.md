- 👋 Hi, I’m @Fractals182 (Draven is my real name)
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Python/SQL for Machine Learning/Data Science
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... In my opinion programming is a constant learning experience regardless of skill level and/or time as innovation is constant! So, with that
being said I like to review the basics of both Python and SQL once a week at minimum even if I've already reviewed it just to keep it fresh in my mind. Pandas is the library I'm
just now diving into. I'll update this as I progress.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Opportunities are honestly what I'm searching for in general. Really anything that I can gain experience from to further my understanding
and develop my skills with Python/SQL.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter - @DravenLackey or via email at Fractals182@yahoo.com
